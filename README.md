### ðŸŒŸ Why does this dotfiles exist???

On the day **Windows 7 was no longer supported by Microsoft**, and my computer was too weak to upgrade to Windows 10, **I decided to switch to Linux**. In the early days of using Linux, I tried Ubuntu and KDE, **but after just a few days, I went back to Windows**. That was until **I stumbled upon UnixPorn**, and suddenly **I realized how amazing Linux could be!!!**.

As someone who loves technology, **I started exploring by installing Arch Linux, Hyprland, and many other things**. After several years, I gained enough knowledge and experience to **truly create a Rice**, a setup where I could showcase the best of Linux.

Creating a Rice from scratch is incredibly **challenging and time-consuming**. I hope that by uploading my dotfiles here, **you will have a template to make it easier to create your own dotfiles**.

And thatâ€™s **the reason this dotfiles exists**.
